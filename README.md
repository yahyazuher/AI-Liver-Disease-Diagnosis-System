# AI-Based Multi-Model System for Liver Disease Risk Assessment

An integrated AI ecosystem designed to assess liver health through a pipeline of machine learning models and clinical rule-based logic. The system leverages **Hepatitis C** clinical data to diagnose liver damage progression, specifically identifying **Fibrosis** and its critical end-stage, **Cirrhosis**, using a **Multi-Stage Classification System** (Stage 1 to 4). Additionally, the pipeline screens for **Blood Donor Eligibility**, detects **Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**, and predicts **Liver Cancer Risk**.

## Project Overview

This repository implements a **multi-model architecture** powered by **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** algorithms to ensure high-performance classification and risk assessment.

**Key System Features:**
- **Specialized Modeling:** Each model focuses on a **specific liver-related condition** rather than a generic output.
- **Interconnected Logic:** Models **do not act independently**; outputs act as flags for subsequent logic layers.
- **Safety-First Veto System:** A built-in logic layer prevents unsafe decisions (e.g., flagging a high-risk patient as a donor).
- **Clinical Grounding:** All predictions are strictly grounded in **clinical guidelines**.
- **Non-Invasive Focus:** The core diagnostic models are designed to minimize reliance on physical measurements, focusing primarily on **routine blood analysis** biomarkers.

## 1. Fatty Liver Diagnosis Model (NAFLD)
Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Diagnosis Model

This model analyzes the interplay between triglyceride levels and liver enzymes to identify inflammatory lipid accumulation. The system features a safety Veto protocol based on "Platelet counts" for the early detection of liver fibrosis markers associated with fatty liver.

(Trained Model): fatty_liver_model.pkl

Core Logic: Connects the "Raw Material" (Triglycerides) with the "Alarm Signal" (ALT/GGT) to distinguish NAFLD from viral hepatitis.

Critical Requirement (Positional Logic): The model processes data as an ordered mathematical matrix; therefore, inputs must be entered in the exact following order: `['Albumin', 'ALP', 'AST', 'ALT', 'Cholesterol', 'Creatinine', 'Glucose', 'GGT', 'Bilirubin', 'Triglycerides', 'Uric_Acid', 'Platelets', 'HDL']`.

## 2. Hepatitis C (HCV) Diagnostic & Prognostic Framework

This ensemble framework assesses liver fibrosis progression and calculates survival risk for **Hepatitis C (HCV)** patients. It integrates structural liver damage with functional outcomes using weighted **XGBoost** architectures to provide a multi-dimensional health assessment.

**(Trained Models):** `hepatitis_stage.pkl`, `hepatitis_complications.pkl`, `hepatiti_status.pkl` (all in `models/` directory).

**Core Logic:** The framework employs a **hierarchical decision-making process** where the predicted histological stage acts as a high-weight input for the final survival probability. This mirrors clinical reality: physical scarring (detected by the Stage model) is a primary driver of functional failure and mortality risk.

**Critical Requirement (Positional Logic):** The system processes clinical markers as a strict mathematical matrix. Inputs must be entered in the exact 15-feature order: `['Bilirubin', 'Cholesterol', 'Albumin', 'Copper', 'Alk_Phos', 'SGOT', 'Tryglicerides', 'Platelets', 'Prothrombin', 'Age', 'Sex', 'Ascites', 'Hepatomegaly', 'Spiders', 'Edema']`.

## 4. Liver Cancer Risk Assessment Model

This model evaluates the probability of developing Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) by analyzing the complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. It utilizes XGBoost weights to determine the impact of each analytical factor.

(Trained Model): cancer_model.pkl

Core Logic: The model demonstrates that a healthy lifestyle can effectively "neutralize" genetic predisposition; hereditary risk remains a "potential" rather than an "inevitable fate" without environmental catalysts (e.g., smoking and alcohol).

Critical Requirement (Positional Logic): The model processes data as an ordered mathematical matrix; therefore, inputs must be entered in the exact following order: `['Age', 'Gender', 'BMI', 'Smoking', 'GeneticRisk', 'PhysicalActivity', 'AlcoholIntake', 'CancerHistory']`.
