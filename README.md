# AI-Based Multi-Model System for Liver Disease Risk Assessment

An integrated AI ecosystem designed to assess liver health through a pipeline of machine learning models and clinical rule-based logic. 

The system leverages **Hepatitis C** clinical data to diagnose liver damage progression, specifically identifying **Fibrosis** and its critical end-stage, **Cirrhosis**, using a **Multi-Stage Classification System** (Stage 1 to 4). Additionally, the pipeline screens for **Blood Donor Eligibility**, detects **Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**, and predicts **Liver Cancer Risk**.


>  This system is for **research and educational purposes only**.  
> It does **not** replace professional medical diagnosis.

##  Project Overview

This repository implements a **multi-model architecture** for liver disease analysis, where:

- Each model focuses on a **specific liver-related condition**
- Models **do not act independently**
- A safety-first **Veto System** prevents unsafe decisions
- All predictions are grounded in **clinical guidelines**

The system is intentionally designed to work **without physical measurements**
(e.g., weight, BMI), relying instead on **routine blood analysis**.

# Fatty Liver Diagnosis Model (NAFLD)
Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Diagnosis Model

This model analyzes the interplay between triglyceride levels and liver enzymes to identify inflammatory lipid accumulation. The system features a safety Veto protocol based on "Platelet counts" for the early detection of liver fibrosis markers associated with fatty liver.

Core Logic: Connects the "Raw Material" (Triglycerides) with the "Alarm Signal" (ALT/GGT) to distinguish NAFLD from viral hepatitis.

Critical Requirement (Positional Logic): The model processes data as an ordered mathematical matrix; therefore, inputs must be entered in the exact following order: ['Albumin', 'ALP', 'AST', 'ALT', 'Cholesterol', 'Creatinine', 'Glucose', 'GGT', 'Bilirubin', 'Triglycerides', 'Uric_Acid', 'Platelets', 'HDL']
