## Developer’s Note

**I, Yahya Zuhair, the owner of this repository, hereby declare that I am a Computer Science student and NOT a medical professional, clinician, or laboratory specialist in any capacity.** This system is a **Graduation Project** developed as part of my academic curriculum. It is designed as a **purely educational and research tool** to demonstrate the application of Machine Learning in healthcare. It is **NOT intended for clinical use** or direct application in hospitals or medical facilities.

## Medical Disclaimer & System Limitations

### 1. General Disclaimer

**This software is for research and educational purposes only.**

The content, models, and predictions provided by this repository are **not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.** Always consult your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it based on information from this system.

### 2. Limitations

The target labels (Healthy vs. Sick) used in this project were inferred based on biochemical thresholds derived from standard clinical guidelines.

## Data & Model Governance

### Model Assets

All serialized models located in the `models/` directory (e.g., `.pkl` files) are finalized and available for use, testing, and evaluation within a research or academic context. These models represent the culmination of the training and optimization phases of this project.

### Raw Datasets (`data/raw/`)

The raw data files provided in this repository are sourced from **official and recognized clinical platforms**. The responsibility for the accuracy, validity, and ethics of this data lies entirely with the **original sources**. Users should refer to the original source licenses and documentation for any redistribution or primary research.

### Processed Datasets (`data/processed/`)

The files in the processed directory are the result of my own technical intervention. I have applied various **Data Engineering** techniques—including cleaning, handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering—to prepare this data for machine learning. These files are optimized specifically for the models within this ecosystem.

### The Cancer Model Exception

It is important to note that the data used for building the **Cancer Risk Model** is the only dataset included without modifications. This specific dataset was obtained from the original source in a state already optimized for machine learning algorithms, and therefore, it was utilized in its original form to maintain its integrity.
