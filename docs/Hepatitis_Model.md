# Hepatitis Diagnostic & Prognostic Framework
This specialized framework is dedicated to evaluating the progression of Liver Fibrosis and predicting the probability of critical complications, such as Ascites, and overall mortality. The system utilizes an ensemble of XGBoost models, with its core logic distributed across three specialized serialized files: hepatitis_stage.pkl, hepatitis_complications.pkl, and hepatitis_status.pkl. By analyzing clinical input values through optimized "feature weights," the framework provides a precise determination of the risk levels associated with key biomarkers.

### Training Phase 

The reliability of the **Hepatitis Diagnostic Framework** is built on a rigorous training pipeline designed to ensure scientific validity and clinical transparency:

* **The  Rule (Generalization):** The processed dataset was split into ** ( records)** for training and ** ( records)** for independent validation. This separation ensures the models do not simply "memorize" the data but learn the underlying clinical patterns necessary to handle new, unseen cases.
* **Stratified Sampling ():** We utilized **Stratified Splitting** to ensure that the distribution of critical outcomes—specifically **Stage 4 (Cirrhosis)** and **Mortality**—remains identical in both the training and testing sets. This prevents a random split from leaving the test set without enough high-risk cases for a fair evaluation.

#### **Model Performance Results**

After completing the training on  records and testing on  unseen records, the models achieved the following confidence levels:

| Model | Accuracy | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`hepatitis_complications.pkl`** | $92.86\%$ %|  High Reliability |
| **`hepatiti_status.pkl`** | $79.76\%$ % | Moderate-High Reliability |
| **`hepatitis_stage.pkl`** | $< 49\%$ % | Academic Use Only |

#### **Stability & Clinical Disclaimer**

By training on a "true representation" of the disease, the framework achieves stable diagnostic confidence for mortality and complications. However, it is imperative to note that while the **Virtual Case Analysis Table** shows logical results, the **`hepatitis_stage.pkl`** model is considered **inaccurate for clinical purposes** due to its low validation score.

> **`hepatitis_stage.pkl`** Included in this repository solely for academic demonstration and as a structural component for the multi-stage AI architecture.

## Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering

### 1. Data Source (Raw Data)

The primary dataset is sourced from the **Cirrhosis Prediction Dataset** hosted on Kaggle (provided by *fedesoriano*), which originates from the renowned **Mayo Clinic** study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).

* **Original Source:** [Kaggle: Cirrhosis Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/cirrhosis-prediction-dataset)
* **Raw File Path:** `data/raw/cirrhosis.csv`

### 2. Feature Engineering Logic

To prepare the raw data for the **XGBoost** model, a rigorous **Data Engineering** phase was executed. The original file (`cirrhosis.csv`) was transformed into the processed training file (`Hepatitis.csv`) located in `data/processed`, resulting in a refined dataset of **419 patient records**.

The following transformations were applied:

#### **A. Target Variable Transformation (Status)**

The goal was to predict specific mortality risk. The original multi-class status was mapped to a binary format:

 **Original Values:**
* `(C:0: Alive/Stable)` (Censored) & `CL` (Censored due to Liver Transplant)  Considered Stable.
* `(D:1: Deceased)` (Death)  Considered Critical Event.

#### **B. Clinical Feature Encoding**

Categorical text values were converted into numerical formats to ensure mathematical compatibility with the model:

| Feature | Transformation Logic | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Age** | `Days / 365.25` | Converted from raw days to **Years** for clinical interpretability. |
| **Sex** | `M`  `1`, `F`  `0` | Binary encoding. |
| **Ascites** | `Y`  `1`, `N`  `0` | Presence vs. Absence. |
| **Hepatomegaly** | `Y`  `1`, `N`  `0` | Liver enlargement indicator. |
| **Spiders** | `Y`  `1`, `N`  `0` | Spider angiomas indicator. |

#### **C. Ordinal Severity Scaling (Edema)**

Unlike binary features, Edema has graduated severity levels. We applied **Ordinal Encoding** to reflect the increasing risk:

* **`N` (No Edema):** Mapped to **0.0**
* **`S` (Slight Edema):** Mapped to **0.5** (Edema resolvable with diuretics)
* **`Y` (Severe Edema):** Mapped to **1.0** (Edema resistant to diuretics)

# AiLDS: AI Liver Disease Diagnosis System

This repository hosts a multi-stage diagnostic framework dedicated to evaluating the progression of **Liver Fibrosis** and predicting the probability of critical complications and mortality. The system leverages an ensemble of **XGBoost** training models to transform complex clinical biomarkers into actionable diagnostic insights. By analyzing specific "feature weights" acquired during the training phase, AiLDS provides a precise determination of the risk levels associated with each patient's profile.

---

## Model Architecture & Integration

The predictive logic of the **AiLDS** is divided into three integrated diagnostic layers. Each layer acts as an independent specialized component, utilizing specific clinical features derived from the processed dataset to provide a comprehensive health assessment.

### 1. Model Breakdown & Feature Selection

| Model File | Input Features (Columns) | Target Output | Clinical Significance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`hepatitis_stage.pkl`** | Core Blood Tests (Bilirubin, Albumin, SGOT, etc.) | Discrete Class: **1, 2, 3, 4** | Determines the level of histological liver scarring (Fibrosis). |
| **`hepatitis_complications.pkl`** | Blood Tests & Physical Signs (excluding 'Ascites') | Probability: **0.0 to 1.0** | Estimates the immediate risk of fluid accumulation (Ascites). |
| **`hepatitis_status.pkl`** | Blood Tests + **Predicted Stage** (from Model 1) | Probability: **0.0 to 1.0** | Calculates the ultimate mortality risk (Survival vs. Death). |

---

### 2. Understanding the `.pkl` Output

When interacting with these serialized models programmatically, the outputs are processed based on the task type:

* **Classification Output (Stage Model):** Returns a discrete numerical class representing the fibrosis stage.
> **Example:** An output of `3` corresponds to **Stage 4 (Cirrhosis)** in the clinical mapping.


* **Probability Output (Complications & Status Models):** We utilize the `predict_proba` function to retrieve a continuous value representing clinical confidence.
> **Example:** A result of `0.92` indicates a **92% probability** of a critical event or complication.



---

### 3. System Workflow & Double Verification Logic

AiLDS is engineered as a **Clinical Decision Support Tool**. To ensure the highest level of safety, the system follows a strict execution sequence and a custom verification protocol.

#### **A. Sequence of Execution**

The system logic is hierarchical. The predicted output of the **Stage Model** is critical because it serves as a high-weight feature for the final **Status Model**.

1. **Input Labs**  **Stage Prediction**.
2. **Input Labs + Predicted Stage**  **Mortality Risk Calculation**.

#### **B. The Double Verification Protocol (High-Risk Stages)**

Because the transition between Stage 3 (Advanced Fibrosis) and Stage 4 (Cirrhosis) is clinically critical, the system implements a **Double Verification Logic**.

* **Trigger:** If the Stage Model predicts a high-risk result (**Stage 3 or 4**), the system automatically re-runs the inference engine.
* **Requirement:** The model must return the **exact same result twice in a row**.
* **Safety Net:** If the two consecutive results are not identical, the system flags a "Verification Mismatch," preventing a potentially false high-risk diagnosis from being presented to the user.

---

### 4. Clinical Interpretation

The system categorizes results based on a probability threshold to assist in rapid triage:

* **🟢 Green Flag (Stable):** If the Mortality Probability is **< 50%**, the case is classified as stable with a recommendation for routine clinical monitoring.
* **🔴 Red Flag (Critical):** If the Mortality Probability is **> 50%**, the case is flagged as critical, requiring immediate medical intervention and further diagnostic confirmation.

---

### 5. Mathematical Validation

To complement the AI's predictive power, the system integrates established clinical scoring systems to provide a "ground truth" reference:

* **APRI Score (AST to Platelet Ratio Index):** Assesses the likelihood of significant fibrosis.


* **ALBI Score (Albumin-Bilirubin Grade):** Evaluates liver functional reserve.

---

### 2- Model Input Requirements

To ensure result accuracy, data must be entered in the strict mathematical order used during the inference phase:
`['Bilirubin', 'Cholesterol', 'Albumin', 'Copper', 'Alk_Phos', 'SGOT', 'Tryglicerides', 'Platelets', 'Prothrombin', 'Age', 'Sex', 'Ascites', 'Hepatomegaly', 'Spiders', 'Edema']`

*Note: The `Status` model appends the predicted `Stage` to this list automatically.*

---

### Optimized Model Configuration

The following parameters were identified as the **"Gold Standard"** for this specific dataset to achieve maximum stability across the three models:

```python
# The optimized XGBoost configuration for Medical Diagnosis
model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,      # Balanced number of trees to prevent complexity
    learning_rate=0.1,     # Optimal step size for stable convergence
    max_depth=3,           # Strategic depth to ensure high generalization
    subsample=0.8,         # Trains on 80% of data per tree to boost robustness
    eval_metric='logloss'  # Standard evaluation metric for binary classification
)

```

> **Scientific Insight:** In medical diagnostics, a `max_depth` of **3** is crucial. It forces the model to make decisions based on the most dominant biomarkers (like Bilirubin and Prothrombin) rather than creating complex, unexplainable branches that might fit noise in the data.

---

### 4. Virtual Clinic Test Results

To demonstrate the practical application of the model, a **"Virtual Clinic"** simulation was conducted using 7 real-world scenarios. This phase validates the model's ability to distinguish between "Structural Damage" (Stage) and "Functional Failure" (Status).

### Virtual Case Analysis Table

| Clinical Case | Brief Description | AI Stage | Survival Risk | Clinical Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. The Healthy Reference** | Normal labs, no symptoms. | **Stage 1** | **1.4%** | Baseline reference for a low-risk profile. |
| **2. Acute Inflammation** | High Bilirubin (3.2), Stage 2. | **Stage 2** | **97.2%** | **Critical:** High mortality despite moderate fibrosis stage. |
| **3. Early Fibrosis** | Moderate APRI score. | **Stage 3** | **2.7%** | Disease is progressing but functionally stable. |
| **4. Compensated Cirrhosis** | Stage 4, but normal Albumin. | **Stage 4** | **0.6%** | **Key Result:** Successful clinical compensation (Type CL). |
| **5. Decompensated Failure** | Stage 4 + Ascites + Low Albumin. | **Stage 4** | **99.9%** | End-stage liver failure; immediate intervention required. |
| **6. Active Injury** | Stage 4 with high Enzymes (SGOT). | **Stage 4** | **92.5%** | High risk due to ongoing active inflammation. |
| **7. The Geriatric Case** | Age 70, Coagulation issues. | **Stage 4** | **98.9%** | Demonstrates the compounded risk of Age + Fibrosis. |

---

### Clinical Insights

Based on the Virtual Clinic outputs, critical technical observations regarding the AiLDS logic were derived:

#### **A. The "Compensated" Paradox (Case 4)**

The model successfully identified a patient with **Stage 4 Cirrhosis** yet assigned a very low mortality risk (**0.6%**). This reflects the clinical reality of "Compensated Cirrhosis," where the liver is scarred but still functional. This aligns with the "CL" (Censored/Transplant) data logic, proving the model is not blindly equating Stage 4 with Death.

#### **B. The Lethality of Bilirubin (Case 2)**

The model assigned a **97% risk** to a Stage 2 patient due to elevated Bilirubin (3.2). This confirms that **XGBoost** has correctly prioritized "Functional Markers" over "Structural Stage" when predicting immediate mortality.

#### **C. Multi-Factor Integration**

In Case 5, the convergence of **Ascites**, **Low Albumin**, and **High Copper** pushed the risk to **99.9%**, demonstrating the model's ability to handle complex, multi-variable failure cascading.
