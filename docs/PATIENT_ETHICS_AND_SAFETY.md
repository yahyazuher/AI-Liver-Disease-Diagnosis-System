# Ethics & Patient Safety

This document explains the **ethical principles and safety mechanisms** used in the  
**Multi-Model AI Liver Disease System**.

The goal is to clarify **why** specific design decisions were made to protect patients,
reduce medical risk, and prevent unsafe AI behavior.

>  Technical details, training logic, and datasets are documented separately under `docs/`
> and `data/processed/` to keep this file focused on ethics and safety only.

## Core Ethical Principles

- **Patient safety comes first**
- **False Negatives are treated as critical failures**
- **No model is allowed to act alone**
- **Uncertainty leads to conservative decisions**
- **AI supports clinicians — it does not replace them**

---

## 1. False Negatives as a High-Risk Ethical Failure

In medical AI, not all errors are equal.

A **False Negative** (classifying a sick or high-risk patient as healthy) can lead to:
- Delayed diagnosis
- Unsafe blood donation
- Direct harm to other patients

For this reason, the system is intentionally designed to be **risk-averse**, prioritizing
safety over optimistic predictions.

## 2. Unified Input & Accountability

### Design Choice
The frontend sends **one unified JSON payload** containing all user data.

### Ethical Benefit
- Prevents selective input manipulation
- Ensures all models analyze the same clinical snapshot
- Improves traceability and accountability

---

## 3. Data Privacy & De-Identification

Patient privacy is treated as a **hard constraint**, not an optional feature.

### Applied Measures
- Engineering identifiers (e.g. `SEQN`) are used **only for data merging**
- All identifiers are dropped **before training**
- Models operate on numerical arrays only
- No personal identity can be reconstructed

(e.g. `SEQN`) Model details:
- `docs/FattyLiver_Model.md`  
- Training data: `data/processed/FattyLiver_Learning_db.csv`

## 4. Guideline-Based Labeling

All target labels are created using **rule-based labeling** grounded in
established clinical guidelines.

### Why This Matters
- Prevents speculative AI decisions
- Makes predictions explainable
- Ensures clinical defensibility

## 5. Scope & Responsibility

This system is a **clinical decision-support tool** only.

- It does **not** replace medical professionals.
- Final responsibility always lies with qualified clinicians.
- This system is for research and educational purposes only.
- When using these tools, I am not responsible for anything in any way.

## Data Privacy & Anonymization Strategy

Respecting patient confidentiality is paramount. This project adheres to strict de-identification protocols to ensure the AI learns biological patterns, not personal identities.

### Handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* **Removal of Explicit Identifiers:** The raw dataset contained a sequence number (`SEQN`) for each patient (docs/FattyLiver_DataEngineering.md and data/processed/FattyLiver_Learning_db.csv). While this was used initially as a **Primary Key** to merge disparate datasets (Biochemistry, CBC, Cholesterol), it was strictly treated as an engineering utility.
* **The "Drop" Protocol:** Before the data enters the training phase (`.fit`), the `SEQN` column is programmatically dropped. The model acts purely on mathematical arrays of biological data, ensuring it is impossible to reverse-engineer the data to identify specific individuals.
* **Attribute Encoding:** Demographic attributes like Gender (Sex) were converted to numerical binary formats (Male=1, Female=0) purely for statistical correlation, stripping away text-based identifiers .

## Responsible Labeling: Guideline-Based Ground Truth

To avoid "AI Hallucinations," the target variables for the **Fatty Liver Model** were not inferred loosely. Instead, we applied a **Rule-Based Labeling** approach grounded in clinical guidelines.

* **Clinical Thresholds:** Diagnoses were established using globally recognized thresholds derived from medical literature:
    * **ALT > 40 IU/L:** Indicator of hepatocellular injury (ACG Guidelines).
    * **Triglycerides > 150 mg/dL:** Indicator of metabolic syndrome (NCEP ATP III).
    * **GGT > 40 IU/L:** A sensitive marker for oxidative stress and fatty liver detection.
* **Justification:** The diagnosis is assigned only when biochemical markers confirm both lipid elevation and liver stress, creating a model that is clinically defensible.
