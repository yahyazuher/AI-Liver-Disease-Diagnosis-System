# Ethical Considerations & Patient Safety Protocols

This document outlines the ethical framework governing the **Multi-Model AI Liver Disease Diagnostic System**, emphasizing patient safety, data privacy, and the fail-safe mechanisms implemented to prevent medical errors.

## 1. The "Veto System": An Ethical Necessity for Blood Safety

In medical AI, a "False Negative" (classifying a sick patient as healthy) is not just a statistical error; it is a life-threatening risk. This project implements a **Veto System** specifically for the Blood Donor Eligibility module to mitigate this risk.

### The Ethical Dilemma
The **Donor Model** relies on biochemical markers. In scenarios where a user lacks specific input values (e.g., ALT, GGT), the system might use default "normal" values to process the request. This creates a risk where the Donor Model incorrectly classifies a candidate as "Eligible".

### The Solution: Cross-Model Validation
We enforce a strict rule: **"The models must not act in isolation."**.
The system integrates the **Fibrosis Model** as a supervisor (Veto Authority) over the Donor Model based on the following logic:

1.  **Independent Analysis:** The Fibrosis Model analyzes different features, specifically **Platelets** and **Prothrombin**, which are critical indicators of liver scarring.
2.  **Conflict Resolution:** If the Donor Model predicts "Eligible" (0), but the Fibrosis Model detects advanced scarring (Stage 2, 3, or 4), the system detects a conflict.
3.  **The Veto Action:** The system automatically overrides the Donor Model's decision, changing the status to **"Rejected"**. This ensures that blood from a patient with hidden liver fibrosis never reaches a recipient.

## 2. Data Privacy & Anonymization Strategy

Respecting patient confidentiality is paramount. This project adheres to strict de-identification protocols to ensure the AI learns biological patterns, not personal identities.

### Handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* **Removal of Explicit Identifiers:** The raw dataset contained a sequence number (`SEQN`) for each patient. [cite_start]While this was used initially as a **Primary Key** to merge disparate datasets (Biochemistry, CBC, Cholesterol), it was strictly treated as an engineering utility.
* **The "Drop" Protocol:** Before the data enters the training phase (`.fit`), the `SEQN` column is programmatically dropped. The model acts purely on mathematical arrays of biological data, ensuring it is impossible to reverse-engineer the data to identify specific individuals.
* **Attribute Encoding:** Demographic attributes like Gender (Sex) were converted to numerical binary formats (Male=1, Female=0) purely for statistical correlation, stripping away text-based identifiers .

## 3. Responsible Labeling: Guideline-Based Ground Truth

To avoid "AI Hallucinations," the target variables for the **Fatty Liver Model** were not inferred loosely. Instead, we applied a **Rule-Based Labeling** approach grounded in clinical guidelines.

* **Clinical Thresholds:** Diagnoses were established using globally recognized thresholds derived from medical literature:
    * **ALT > 40 IU/L:** Indicator of hepatocellular injury (ACG Guidelines).
    * **Triglycerides > 150 mg/dL:** Indicator of metabolic syndrome (NCEP ATP III).
    * **GGT > 40 IU/L:** A sensitive marker for oxidative stress and fatty liver detection.
* **Justification:** The diagnosis is assigned only when biochemical markers confirm both lipid elevation and liver stress, creating a model that is clinically defensible.

**Disclaimer:** This system is designed as a decision-support tool and does not replace professional medical diagnosis. The "Veto System" acts as a computational safeguard, not a guarantee of clinical safety.
